Hi, welcome to my homepage. I am Guozheng, an assistant professor at School of Computer Science, Beijing Intitute of Technology, China. Before joining BIT, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the School of EECS, Peking University in 2021, supervised by Prof. Xiaoru Yuan in the <a href='https://vis.pku.edu.cn/wiki/'>Visualization and Visual Analytics Group</a>. I received my Bachelor degree of Computer Science (Elite Class) from <a href='https://en.sdu.edu.cn/'>Shandong University</a> in 2016. 

My research interests are information visualization, machine learning, human-computer interaction and virtual / augmented reality. Specifically, I have been working on visualization tools (e.g., HiTailor, CoInsight), visualization libraries (e.g., BarcodeTree, GoTree), and visual analytics systems (e.g., TokenVis, LitVis).

I am always looking for highly-motivated undergraduate or graduated students to work with me. Please drop me an email if you are interested or come directly to my office and have a cup of coffee :smile:.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
