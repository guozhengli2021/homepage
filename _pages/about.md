Hi, welcome to my homepage. I am Guozheng, an assistant professor at School of Computer Science, Beijing Intitute of Technology, China. My research interest is about information visualization, human-computer interaction. 

Before joining BIT, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at the School of EECS, Peking University in 2021, supervised by Prof. Xiaoru Yuan in the <a href='https://vis.pku.edu.cn/wiki/'>Visualization and Visual Analytics Group</a>. I received my Bachelor degree of Computer Science (Elite Class) from <a href='https://en.sdu.edu.cn/'>Shandong University</a> in 2016.
