Welcome to my homepage! I'm Guozheng, currently serving as an assistant professor at the School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology in China. My journey in academia began with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the School of EECS, <a href='https://english.pku.edu.cn/'>Peking University</a>, under the guidance of <a href='https://vis.pku.edu.cn/xiaoruyuan.html'>Prof. Xiaoru Yuan</a> in the <a href='https://vis.pku.edu.cn/wiki/'>Visualization and Visual Analytics Group</a>. Additionally, I've had the privilege of collaborating with <a href='https://www.michaelmcguffin.com/'>Prof. Michael McGuffin</a> at ETS, Canada. My academic foundation was laid with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Elite Class) from  <a href='https://en.sdu.edu.cn/'>Shandong University</a> in 2016.

My primary research interests encompass information visualization, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and the realms of virtual/augmented reality. Specifically, my focus has been on developing innovative visualization tools (e.g., HiTailor and CoInsight), crafting visualization libraries (e.g., BarcodeTree and GoTree), and contributing to the development of visual analytics systems (e.g., TokenVis and LitVis).

I am always eager to collaborate with highly-motivated undergraduate or graduate students. If you're interested in exploring potential research opportunities, feel free to reach out via email (guozhg.li<at>gmail.com; guozheng.li<at>bit.edu.cn). Additionally, drop by my office for a chat and perhaps a cup of coffee â€“ I'm always open to discussions! :grin:
